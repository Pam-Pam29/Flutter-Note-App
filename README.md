## Layer Responsibilities

Data Layer: Handles data operations, API calls, and local storage
Business Logic Layer: Contains application logic and state management
Presentation Layer: UI components and user interactions


### Build Steps
**Prerequisites**

Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
Firebase account
Android Studio / VS Code
Git

1. Clone Repository
```bash
